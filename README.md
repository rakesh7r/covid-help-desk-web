# Covid-19 Help Desk
>In such hard times where the severity of the pandemic has shown itâ€™s ultimate form and is not going to stop by any means, it is an high time where the patients struck by the COVID-19 require proper medication and medical help.
At the present situation we see that most of the people are not able to get the proper medication due to the lack of information where the required medical assistance is available.
We have come up with a solution, where people can search for their required medical assistance. We believe this would at least decrease some extent of the damage caused by the pandemic.

>We mainly focus on providing the information of the availability of the resources to the people who need them. One could just go to the website and get all the hospitals nearby with his required resources.
The information regarding the resources is mainly provided by the hospital management where they update the data regularly as they use the resources.
The government can monitor the validity of the information uploaded by the hospitals.
This would not only help the people but also help the government where and when the resources are being used, which prevents the moving out of such important resources into the black markets.
